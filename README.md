# Arduino Controlled Oxygen Regulation System for Indoor Environment
### Introduction
Arduino-Controlled-Oxygen-Regulation-System-for-Indoor-Environment is an IoT Project Designed and developed an innovative system utilizing Arduino UNO and MQ-135 gas sensor technology to regulate indoor air quality by dynamically monitoring CO2 levels. 
Implemented threshold-based control mechanisms and an exhaust fan to ensure optimal oxygen concentrations. 
Demonstrated a prototype responsive to indoor air fluctuations, laying the foundation for enhanced environmental regulation solutions.

### Working
The working principle of the "Arduino Controlled Oxygen Regulation System for Indoor Environment" involves the MQ-135 gas sensor detecting real-time CO2 levels. This sensor sends analog data to the Arduino UNO, which interprets the information using preloaded code. If the CO2 levels indicate adequate oxygen, a green LED indicates this status, and the system keeps the exhaust fan off. However, if the CO2 levels suggest low oxygen, the LED turns off, signaling the need for improved air quality. Consequently, the Arduino activates the exhaust fan to enhance ventilation until the oxygen levels restore to an optimal state, ensuring a regulated indoor environment conducive to human comfort and well-being.
